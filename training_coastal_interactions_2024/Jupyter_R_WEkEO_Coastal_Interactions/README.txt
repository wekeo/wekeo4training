Readme of the R Notebook on WEkEO Coastal Interactions


Copy/Paste Jupyter_R_WEkEO_Coastal_Interactions outside Public Directory:

Step 1: On the left of the JupyterHub interface. Return to the root of the project folder and copy the entire folder. Here is the path to the folder concerned: 
	/public/wekeo4training/training_coastal_interactions_2024/Jupyter_R_WEkEO_Coastal_Interactions

Step 2: Paste the copied folder into a directory outside the "public" directory. 
        For example, you can paste it into a "work" directory or any directory where you plan to work with the data.

Step 3: Verify that the project folder and all its contents have been successfully moved to the new location.

After completing these steps, you can proceed with downloading data files and running the project in its new location.



Downloading Data Files:

The data files required to run this project are available via a link provided. Follow these steps to download and install them correctly:

Step 1: Click on the following link to access the necessary files: https://atlas.mercator-ocean.fr/s/j4bCpFeSDDwFgfY

Step 2: Download the data to your computer.

Step 3: Transfer the files from your computer to the JupyterHub in a “data” folder in Jupyter_R_WEkEO_Coastal_Interactions folder. The "data" folder should be located at the same root as your R notebook and this Readme (outside the "public" folder).

Step 4: If the folder you're uploading is zipped, use the command “unzip folder.zip” in a terminal. Make sure you only have one data folder.

Finally:
Use the correct kernel, which is the R kernel, where most of the libraries are installed. If any are missing, use the install.packages(”package“) command.
