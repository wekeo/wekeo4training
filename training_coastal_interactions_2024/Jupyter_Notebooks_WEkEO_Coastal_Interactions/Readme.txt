Readme of the Jupyter Notebook on WEkEO Coastal Interactions


Moving Data Out of the Public Directory

Step 1: Return to the root of the project folder and copy the entire folder. Here is the path to the folder concerned: 
	/public/wekeo4training/training_coastal_interactions_2024/Jupyter_Notebooks_WEkEO_Coastal_Interactions

Step 2: Paste the copied folder into a directory outside the "public" directory. 
        For example, you can paste it into a "work" directory or any directory where you plan to work with the data.

Step 3: Verify that the project folder and all its contents have been successfully moved to the new location.

After completing these steps, you can run the project in its new location.
