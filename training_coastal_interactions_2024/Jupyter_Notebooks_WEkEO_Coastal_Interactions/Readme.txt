Readme of the Jupyter Notebook on WEkEO Coastal Interactions


Copy/Paste Jupyter_Notebooks_WEkEO_Coastal_Interactions outside Public Directory:

Step 1: On the left of the JupyterHub interface. Return to the root of the project folder and copy the entire folder. Here is the path to the folder concerned: 
	/public/wekeo4training/training_coastal_interactions_2024/Jupyter_Notebooks_WEkEO_Coastal_Interactions

Step 2: Paste the copied folder into a directory outside the "public" directory. 
        For example, you can paste it into a "work" directory or any directory where you plan to work with the data.

Step 3: Verify that the project folder and all its contents have been successfully moved to the new location.

After completing these steps, you can run the project in its new location.

Finally:
Use the "wekeolab" kernel. It is available via the Earth Observation Tools server. If you want to change server, go to the top of the JupyterHub in File->Hub Control Panel, then stop your server and restart it.
