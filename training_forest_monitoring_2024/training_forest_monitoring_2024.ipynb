    "Wildfires have a long list of socioeconomic impacts, including material and human losses, biodiversity loss, and the advancement of desertification, among others. In addition to these direct impacts, wildfires are also a significant source of pollutant emissions that severely affect air quality and thus public health. Among the main pollutants generated by wildfires are **carbon monoxide (CO)**, a toxic gas released in large quantities due to the incomplete combustion of biomass, and **nitrogen dioxide (NO₂)**, formed in the atmosphere from the reaction of compounds such as **nitric oxide (NO)** and **nitrogen monoxide (NO)**. Additionally, large amounts of **sulfur dioxide (SO₂)**, a gas that contributes to acid rain formation, and **carbon dioxide (CO₂)**, one of the main greenhouse gases, are emitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wildfires also generate suspended particles, especially **fine particulate matter (PM2.5)**, which can penetrate deep into the lungs, causing respiratory problems, and reach the bloodstream, leading to various cardiovascular conditions. The combination of these pollutants creates a significant burden on ecosystems, the atmosphere, and exposed populations, especially in areas close to the fires or under the influence of air currents that carry these emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will showcase some Copernicus data sources that allow us to assess pollutant emissions from wildfires and their impact on air quality. To do so, we will focus on three wildfires that occurred on the Iberian Peninsula (Pedrogao in 2017, Losacio in 2022) and in Greece (Alexandroupoli in 2023).\n",
    "\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is designed to be executed using two different datasets. The first is the Copernicus air quality reanalysis product, which will allow us to check the estimated air quality levels for the dates of the study events. The other product contains data on emissions associated with wildfires. Therefore, it is suggested to run this tutorial multiple times using both datasets. It is important to mention that emissions data and air quality data are not the same, so as we will see, the results obtained with one product or the other, while similar, will not be directly comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Used Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "The Copernicus Service offers a wide variety of environmental data that can be used for multiple purposes. The available products include observational data, remote sensing, modeling, ocean and climate indicators, etc. Each type of data has its own characteristics, such as spatial and temporal resolution, available variables (physical, chemical, biogeochemical), frequency of database updates, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will focus on studying the impact of wildfires on air quality; therefore, we will use data provided by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). Among the variety of available CAMS data are reanalysis data and emissions data derived from remote sensing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[CAMS Global Reanalysis (EAC4)](https://www.wekeo.eu/data?view=dataset&dataset=EO%3AECMWF%3ADAT%3ACAMS_GLOBAL_REANALYSIS_EAC4)** \n",
    "* **[CAMS Global Biomass Burning Emissions Based on Fire Radiative Power (GFAS)](https://www.wekeo.eu/data?view=dataset&dataset=EO%3AECMWF%3ADAT%3ACAMS_GLOBAL_FIRE_EMISSIONS_GFAS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "These data are obtained through reanalysis and remote sensing. These types of products are characterized by being generated over a spatial grid that provides high spatial and temporal coverage, allowing us to assess information across the entire study area with high resolution and to conduct temporal studies without the need to deal with missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two datasets used in this tutorial will be described in detail in Section [Accessing Data](#Accessing_Data).\n",
    "\n",
    "As can be observed, we will use two different products for our study. First, we will focus our analysis on the air quality levels estimated by reanalysis product, and then we will conduct the same study using emissions data derived from remote sensing. This will allow us to observe the differences between pollutant emissions and the observed air quality.\n",

    "<b>Congratulations!</b> You have successfully completed the introductory-intermediate tutorial on using Copernicus products to study forest fire events. Throughout this tutorial, we have explained the essential tools needed to access and visualize WEkEO data on air quality and pollutant emissions associated with wildfires. Additionally, we have demonstrated how working with anomaly data allows for the assessment of the impact of emissions from specific fires.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you have acquired all the information needed to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use the Harmonized Data Access API provided by WEkEO to download diverse datasets from the following WEkEO products:\n",
    "    * [CAMS Global Reanalysis (EAC4)](https://www.wekeo.eu/data?view=dataset&dataset=EO%3AECMWF%3ADAT%3ACAMS_GLOBAL_REANALYSIS_EAC4)\n",
    "    * [CAMS Global Biomass Burning Emissions Based on Fire Radiative Power (GFAS)](https://www.wekeo.eu/data?view=dataset&dataset=EO%3AECMWF%3ADAT%3ACAMS_GLOBAL_FIRE_EMISSIONS_GFAS)\n",
    "* Access NetCDF datasets.\n",
    "* Navigate through the various variables, dimensions, and attributes of a NetCDF file.\n",
    "* Plot maps of any variable.\n",
    "* Create a figure containing multiple plots.\n",
    "* Compute temporal means of NetCDF files.\n",
    "* Plot maps of temporal averages.\n",
    "* Compute anomalies associated with specific periods.\n",
    "* Plot anomaly maps for any variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "We sincerely hope you have enjoyed the tutorial and found it informative. Please note that the tutorial has a progressive difficulty, quickly advancing from basic concepts to intermediate levels. Our goal is for all users to find useful information, tailored to their skill level.\n",
    "\n",
    "We understand that for users without prior experience, fully grasping all the procedures in the tutorial may be challenging and require some effort. However, we encourage everyone to embrace the challenge, as this is just the beginning of a journey towards a deeper understanding of environmental analysis.\n",

    "<h3>Final Exercise:</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Repeat the analysis performed in this tutorial but focusing on a different region and event.**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The proposed exercise should be carried out by introducing the necessary changes in the different code cells. You can take any wildfire that occurred between January 2013 and December 2023 in any region of the world as an example. We suggest the wildfire that occurred in the town of Alexandroupoli (Greece, 40.5º North and 25.5º East) from August 21 to 28, 2023. Below is a brief summary of the points where changes should be made:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[2. Accessing Data](#Sect2)**\n",
    "   * It is necessary to change the latitude and longitude range for data download. In the proposed example, we suggest using:\n",
    "   * `MinLat = 36`\n",
    "   * `MaxLat = 45`\n",
    "   * `MinLon = 22`\n",
    "   * `MaxLon = 29`\n",
    "   \n",
    "* **[4. Visualization of Average Values During a Forest Fire](#Sect4)**\n",
    "   * A new date range for the study should be introduced in the `WildfireDatesDict` dictionary. In the proposed case, we suggest using:\n",
    "   * `'Alexandroupolis' : ['2023-08-21', '2023-08-28']`\n",
    "   * `StudyWildfire = 'Alexandroupolis'`\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the conclusions that can be drawn from the analysis of air quality and emissions, one of the main conclusions we can draw from this exercise is the ease with which we can replicate this study anywhere in the world. As can be seen, it is enough to download the data from the desired area, and the rest of the code cells can function perfectly with very small modifications.\n",
